README: Titanic Data Science Project

Project Overview:

The Titanic Data Science Project aims to analyze the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.
This dataset contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including details such as passenger class, age, sex, and survival status.

Project Objectives:

Explore the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and variables.
Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
Build predictive models to determine factors influencing passenger survival.
Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing model.
Draw conclusions and insights from the analysis to understand the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic.

Project Structure:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filled in the missing values where possible and added a new type of Cabin for people who were without a cabin in the Titanic
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the relationship between the survival of an individual with the different types of data provided in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing features such as CabinLetter and CabinNumber, Fare based on how rich a passenger was, the title of a specific passenger, based on their ticket type.
The fare feature engineering is in the titanic changes file as after implementing it the model accuracy actually reduced.
Model Building: Trained various machine learning models such as logistic regression, SVM and random forest to predict passenger survival.
Conclusion: Based on the graph present at the end of the lr we can see which coefficients influenced the most in the survival of a passenger and our model accuracy
was above 80% for all the different models implemented.
