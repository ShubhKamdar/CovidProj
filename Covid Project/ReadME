README: COVID Dataset - Data Analytics Project

Project Overview:

The COVID Dataset Data Analytics Project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on various nations over a specific time period.
This project utilizes a dataset comprising 15 million data points related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, and other relevant factors. 
The analysis aims to uncover insights into the spread of the virus, its effects on different regions, and trends over time.

Project Objectives:

Use SQL Server Import and Export wizard to load the Data into SSMS.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and trends of COVID-19 cases and related metrics.
Utilize SQL queries to extract essential data from the dataset for further analysis.
Construct an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize and communicate key insights effectively.
Investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various nations, including factors such as infection rates, mortality rates, testing strategies, and vaccination efforts.
Identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data to inform decision-making and public health strategies.
Use SQL to cut the data in such a way that Tableau does not have issues while we inset the data into it.
Create a Tableau Dashboard to present the insights.

Key Project Activities:

Data Collection: Obtain the COVID-19 dataset containing relevant information such as cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination data for different countries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset using SQL queries to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in COVID-19 data across nations and over time.
Data Extraction: Utilize SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SQLSMS) to extract essential data subsets required for visualization and analysis.
Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize the extracted data insights effectively.
Visualization: Create visualizations to represent COVID-19 metrics dynamically.
Insights Generation: Derive actionable insights from the data analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different nations and inform decision-making processes.
Documentation: Document the analysis methodology, findings, and insights obtained from the project for reference and future analysis.
